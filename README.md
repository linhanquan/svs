slic video segmentation
=======================

What this is
------------

interactive foreground/background "video" segmentation. 
uses SLIC superpixels (1) (with temporal extension) and a variant of Grabcut (2) 
to perform the segmentation. The optimization itself (binary segmentation with TV
regularization) is solved by Chambolle-Pock's primal-dual method (3).
